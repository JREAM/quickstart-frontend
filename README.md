# Quickstart Frontend

Just a quickstart to whip up some front-end code while feeling lazy.

This is nothing fancy:

- `bootstrap-4-simple`: Basic Bootstrap Layout with CDN, HTML and plain CSS, JS.
- `resources`: Random things, perhaps assets.
- `react-basic`: Generated from `create-react-app`
- `vue-standalone`: Template Using CDN for Vue (Don't use _ES6_)
- `vue-webpack`: Generated from `vue-cli`
-
